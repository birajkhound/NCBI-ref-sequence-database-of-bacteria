The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) is a division of the National Library of Medicine at the NIH that serves as a central hub for global biomedical data.

The complete bacterial reference sequence database maintained by NCBI serves as a comprehensive and curated collection of bacterial genomic information, widely used for research in genomics, microbiology, and bioinformatics.

The NCBI FTP server, operated by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), functions as a public data repository that enables researchers to download large-scale biological datasets in bulk. This mode of access is particularly important for handling high-volume data that cannot be efficiently retrieved through interactive web interfaces.

The FTP server is primarily used to obtain:
1) Genome sequences
2) Protein sequences
3) Gene and genome annotations
4) Taxonomy and classification data
5) Associated literature and metadata

Due to funding-related constraints, NCBI discontinued web-based frontend access to the NCBI database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) in August 2025. However, uninterrupted access to the data has been preserved through the NCBI FTP server, which continues to support bulk downloads, automated pipelines, and large-scale computational analyses.

Researchers can access the data through:
NCBI FTP Repository: https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
Bacterial RefSeq Repository: https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/bacteria/

This FTP-based access ensures continued availability of authoritative bacterial reference sequences and supports reproducible research, large-scale comparative genomics, and bioinformatics workflows despite the absence of a web interface.
